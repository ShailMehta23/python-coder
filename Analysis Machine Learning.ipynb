    "    Interface Customization: One of the many reasons why computer users prefer Windows over Mac is that the former offers better customization options.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Hardware Customization: PC users also have an advantage which Mac users miss out on when it comes to hardware customization. For instance, Mac users have no choice but to opt for an external hard drive to expand their storage capacity, whereas a PC user can easily customize the specs of their computer to enjoy an enhanced experience. PC holds a clear edge over its nemesis by offering better hardware customization options.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Compatibility: Getting compatible software and peripherals for a PC is much easier than for a Mac. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    PC Gamers: Consumers who love to play computer games prefre windows over Mac because it is more compartible. It lets them play online multiplayer games together. Windows PCs have far more software created for them. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    PCs have more opportunities for touch screens. With Windows 8 and Windows 10 created with touch screens in mind; laptops can convert to tablets, desktops can use touch screen monitors, and tablets can be used like computers.\n",

    "    Vertical Integration: Vertical integration dictates that one company controls the end product as well as its component parts. In technology, Apple for 35 years has championed a vertical model, which features an integrated hardware and software approach.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Seamless Integration: Consumers can start an email, note or document on their iPhone or iPad and continue on their  Mac without syncing or saving anything to cloud. Apple seamless integration is on another level. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Security: Macs are continually shown to suffer less attacks than Windows-based PCs, and by quite a margin. Because there are fewer Apple products compared to PCs, there are fewer viruses created for Apple software.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Great Customer Service: Apple’s customer service is well known for being better. Because there are so many possible PC makers, it’s hard to do a direct comparison, but in general, Apple does a great job of backing up their products\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Macs tend to have new innovations incorporated into their design faster than PCs. Because there is just one manufacturer of Apple products, they can move more quickly when there is a hardware innovation like USB-C.\n",
